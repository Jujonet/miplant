# MiPlant #

A Python-library for reading cheap plant monitoring sensors manufactured by Xiaomi.


## Usage

```python
from miplant import MiPlant

for plant in MiPlant.discover():
    print(plant.temperature)
```

## Overview

The sensors read 4 values:

- temperature in degrees Celsius
- light level in lux
- moisture level in percent
- conductivity in ÂµS/cm (presented as "fertility" in many places, even the official app)

The values are only read when the `MiPlant.read()` -function is called, or
when one of the values is requested for the first time.

## Notes

- The sensors seem to have some kind of internal cache, so don't even bother reading them too frequently.
- Currently only tested with Python 2.7, but should work if `gattlib` works...

I wouldn't have bothered with reverese engineering the messages myself :P
